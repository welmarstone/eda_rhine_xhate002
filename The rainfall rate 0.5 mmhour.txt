The rainfall rate: 0.5 mm/hour
Rainfall Duration: 24 hours
Catchment area of the River: 185.000 km2


 Catchment area in square meters:
185.000 km2 = 185.000 × 10⁶ m2 = 185 × 10⁹ m2

Total rainfall over 24 hours:
0.5 mm/hour × 24 hours = 12 mm = 0.012 meters

Volume = Area × Rainfall Depth

Volume = 1.85 × 10¹¹ m² × 0.012 m = 2.22 × 10⁹ m³
