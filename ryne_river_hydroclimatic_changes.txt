In addition to the monthly discharge analysis described earlier, Middelkoop et al. (2001) report several significant hydroclimatic changes affecting the Rhine River basin. These include an increase in winter precipitation, particularly in the Alpine regions, which raises the risk of winter flooding. The study also notes a reduction in snow storage due to rising temperatures, leading to earlier snowmelt and shifting the seasonal timing of runoff. Summer runoff is projected to decline, driven by reduced snowmelt and increased evapotranspiration. Furthermore, the study identifies greater variability and an increased frequency of extreme events such as floods and droughts. Finally, higher temperatures are expected to elevate evaporation rates, further contributing to the summer drying trend across parts of the catchment.
